Grass Envy
The intent of our game was to expand our knowledge on unity to make a more complex game that has more options for the player than the previous game.
The story of this is that there is a person named “Parrot” who is envious of their neighbor’s lawn, so in a fit of rage, he decided to cut all of it down with a sword he stole from a wizard. However, what he doesn’t know is that his neighbor is secretly the flash, but also has very poor eyesight.
The mechanics of this game use the arrow keys to move up, down, left, and right, and using the mouse to click on the grass to destroy it if the player is nearby. We used Open Game Pixel art for all our sprites. One of the main struggles was the particle and trail system because they were not appearing in the exact locations, and the trail system did not work effectively at first. However, the joy of this was getting so much of the scripts down, such as the movement scripts, having the enemy going to specific locations and repeating it over and over again.

I made the audio assets, as well as the NPC movement working. Particle Systems were implemented as well. I also added some basic assets that were needed in the beginning. Furthermore, I added the basic collisions with the player and other objects.
